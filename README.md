## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Many years ago I made a website for friends, using only html. This project is completely new to me in HTML5 and CSS3.
I wouldn't say I learned it yet, but it was fun for me to find the solution. That doesn't mean it's good.
Positioning was also difficult, and the placement and coloring of the SVG icon.
